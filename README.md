# The Grand Mystery

I have a backup of my programming work from every college CS class I've ever taken... exceptâ€”somehowâ€”my very first semester at Willamette University... What!? Where!? How!? ðŸ˜‘ *sigh*...

## What Probably Happened

My best guess: I must have deleted the original folder thinking it had been backed up already.

Around the time I entered university I got a new computer and moved all of my data from my old machine to the new one. I *also* cleaned up my backup drive and put in place new scripts for backing up and compressing my data to it. Unfortunately, I didn't find the error in my backup until more recently when I wanted to add the virtual machine and assembler I built in my Architecture and Compilers class to my Homework Graveyard repo. It's been years since that first class and only Past Me knows what really went wrong. Too bad I don't have that guys number.

## What Now?

In trying to contact my university professor and adviser I found out that he "retired" just after I graduated. (I wonder what happened... ðŸ˜¬) Luckily, the vast majority of his assignment write-ups were online and could still be downloaded from the school. So, I've done just that, and I'd like to rebuild the VM I made for fun and practice. After that I think I'll build a better one, but I want a refresher first.

# The Project

## PC-231

Professor Fritz Ruehr came up with a number of virtual machines over the years, and the one he picked for my class was the PC-231.
>  This version of a simple instructional computer is actually the third in a series (the other two were the PC-101 from Oberlin College and the SCA-130 from the Fall 1997 *Computing Concepts* course). The original idea for this approach came from my wife, Carol Goldfarb. Brian Davis (a visiting faculty member during 1997-98) contributed to ideas and documentation for an improved version. The current version is the most sophisticated, sporting indirect addressing, multiple I/O devices, etc. â€” Fritz

The PC-231 is a 12-bit computer supporting 16 fixed-width CPU instructions and 256 12-bit words of RAM. It is a stored-program computer where programs instructions are also considered data and loaded in to memory when the machine is booted up.

Several "external devices" can be connected to the PC-231, with 3 being so integral to its operation that they get their own mnemonic codes in the assembly language of the machine. It's possible to have up to 16 total devices connected, but (aside from the follow 3) no other devices were used in the original class, though a few graphics devices were mentioned off-hand.

| Device               | Code    | Mnemonic  | Description                                                        |
|--------------------  |-------  |---------  |------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| Decimal Device       | `0000`  | `DD`      | Reads (or writes) integers from a terminal.                        |
| Hexadecimal Device   | `0001`  | `HD`      | Reads (or writes) integers in a hex format from a terminal.        |
| ASCII Device         | `0010`  | `AD`      | Reads (or writes) characters from a terminal in the ASCII format.  |

The CPU has 16 registers: 10 general purpose registers, 4 jump registers, a single data register, and a modifiable program counter.

| Register Name           | Register Code    | Hex        | Mnemonic     |
|-----------------------  |----------------  |----------  |------------  |
| General Registers       | `0000` - `1001`  | `0` - `9`  | `R0` - `R9`  |
| Address/Jump Registers  | `1010` - `1101`  | `A` - `D`  | `J0` - `J3`  |
| The Data Register       | `1110`           | `E`        | `DR`         |
| The Program Counter     | `1111`           | `F`        | `PC`         |

Each instruction is *exactly* 12 bits in size, even if not all bits are needed. The first nibble specifies the operational code, and the remaining byte is used to represent operands or arguments.

The following table specifies each instruction, and its possible arguments, in 4-bit patterns.

| Op Code  | Hex  | Mnemonic  | Argument Format  | Description                                                                    |

| `0101`   | `5`  | `SHIFT`   | `RRRR sNNN`      | Shifts register `RRRR` left (-) or right (+) by from 1 to 8 bits               |
| `0110`   | `6`  | `ADD`     | `RRR1 RRR2`      | Adds the contents of register `RRR1` to `RRR2` (result in `RRR2`)              |

| `1011`   | `B`  | `STORE`   | `RRR1 RRR2`      | Stores the contents of register `RRR1` into location addressed by `RRR2`       |
